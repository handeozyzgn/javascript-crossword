# javascript-crossword
Crossword puzzle written in JavaScript using JQuery.

## Usage

Because of the use of ajax to fetch the crossword puzzles, you need to run a server locally in order to run it on your machine. I included a package.json file to install lite-server and run it.

    $ git clone https://github.com/zacksoliman/javascript-crossword.git
    $ cd javascript-crossword
    $ npm install
    $ npm start

This will open your default browser to the application page.
